The inhabitants of the Alps like their mountains and nature
and they also protect these. Therefore it is understandable
that earthworks, construction and tree cutting encounter
little support. To go to issues out of the way, in all cantons
of the region new regulations are implemented. Here are the
key excerpts:<br>
<br>
<em>·</em> The rock pressure on tunnel is relevant for their approval.<br>
<em>·</em> Supply three material wholesalers with sufficient planks and
tunnels of the first level released rock pressure. When all wholesalers
are supplied, there are two levels.<br>
<em>·</em> for each material wholesalers with sufficient steel and concrete
it is one further level approved rock pressure for tunnels.<br>
<em>·</em> Earthwork cost each {price_terra}.<br>
<em>·</em> The nearest town decides on earthworks.<br>
<em>·</em> The citizens allow maximum {terra_max} earth moving ahead each city.<br>
<em>·</em> After {terra_forget} months the people forget one earthwork.<br>
<em>·</em> People from cities which have a minimum growth {terra_growth}
will forget twice.<br>
<em>·</em> Cities without growth in the past twelve months don't forget any earth movements.<br>
<em>·</em> Each tree cost {price_tree} to cut down.<br>
<em>·</em> The citizens do not want new factories. <br>
<em>·</em> No routing over crowded stations.<br>
<em>·</em> The air in the mountains, from level 6 on, is to thin for passengers.<br>
<em>·</em> Cannels can only be built to level -5 in the lowlands.<br>
<em>·</em> New runways are only in the lowlands to level -6 approved.<br>

Currently, the maximum rock pressure for tunnels is {tunnel_max} levels.
The target set for planks is {target_good_1} units, for steel and concrete
are {target_good_2} units at the beginning of the month for the last twelve
month. List of used materials (concrete / steel / planks). <br>
